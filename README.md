# NewScientistClonePage
Cloning a page from the New Scientist site to practice positioning and floating

This project file is from The Odin Project HTML/CSS section where we learn to position HTML elements in CSS with float, grid, and flexbox. The primary focus of the clone page is to position elements, not necessarily to make sure all links redirect appropriately. Considering there is no JavaScript the forms are not expected to work as well but rather to reflect the design as closely as possible. Responsive design is not yet taken into consideration.
